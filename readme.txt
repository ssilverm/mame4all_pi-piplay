MAME4ALL for Pi by Squid
========================

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a MAME Raspberry Pi port based on Franxis MAME4ALL which is itself based on the MAME 0.37b5 emulator by Nicola Salmoria.
To see MAME license see the end of this document.
It emulates all arcade games supported by original MAME 0.37b5 plus some additional games from newer MAME versions.

This version emulates 2270 different romsets.

Although this is an old version of MAME it plays much faster than the newer versions and as the Pi is relatively CPU underpowered (yes even the RPi2) it was chosen to get as many games working at full speed as possible (full speed means 100% with no frame skip). It also plays most of the games I'm interested in playing!

This is a highly optimised version for the Raspberry Pi, using GLES2/dispmanx for graphics, ALSA for sound and SDL for input. It also uses the GPU for post-processing effects like scanlines.

(No asking for ROMS)

CONTROLS
--------

These are the standard MAME key definitions as follows. All MAME keys are also available.

  * Keys LControl, LAlt, Space, LShift are the fire buttons
  * Cursors Keys for up, down, left and right
  * Keys 1 & 2 to start 1 or 2 player games
  * Keys 5 & 6 Insert credits for 1P or 2P
  * Key Escape to quit
  * Key TAB to bring up the MAME menu
  * Function Keys: F11 show fps, F10 toggle throttle, F5 cheats, Shift F11 show profiler
  * Key P to pause

NOTE: To type OK when MAME requires it with the joystick, press LEFT and then RIGHT.

INSTALLATION
------------

For the Pi Store version place the ROMS in the directory:
/usr/local/bin/indiecity/InstalledApps/mame4all/Full/roms/

    mame        -> MAME and frontend.
    mame.cfg    -> MAME configuration file, limited support to only the options in the supplied file (not the full MAME settings)
    cheat.dat   -> Cheats definition file
    hiscore.dat -> High Scores definition file
    artwork/    -> Artwork directory
    cfg/        -> MAME configuration files directory
    frontend/   -> Frontend configuration files
    hi/         -> High Scores directory
    inp/        -> Game recordings directory
    memcard/    -> Memory card files directory
    nvram/      -> NVRAM files directory
    roms/       -> ROMs directory
    samples/    -> Samples directory
    skins/      -> Frontend skins directory
    snap/       -> Screen snapshots directory
    sta/        -> Save states directory

To run MAME simple run the "mame" executable. At the command line "./mame".

This runs the GUI frontend by default. To simply run MAME without the GUI
enter "./mame {gamerom}" where "{gamerom}" is the game to run.

It will work in X-Windows or in the Console (which is preferred).

Pi CONFIGURATION
----------------

I highly recommend overclocking your Raspberry Pi to gain maximum performance as MAME is very CPU intensive and overclocking will make most games run at full speed. The Pi 2 does not require overclocking.

Overclocking is supported by the Raspberry Foundation.

My overclocking settings which work well, (/boot/config.txt)

    arm_freq=900
    core_freq=300
    sdram_freq=500

NOTE: Make sure overclocking is actually working by checking "cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor" should be "ondemand". Later kernels appear to set it to "powersave" by default. You will also need to make this permanent after a reboot.

I'd also recommend a minimum of 64MB for the GPU RAM allocation (gpu_mem=64).

If your sound is too quiet then do the following to fix that:

* First get the playback device, type "amixer controls"
* This will show the numid for the playback device, probably 3.
* Now set the volume, type "amixer cset numid=3 90%".
* Then reboot to make it permanent.

If you're having problems with HDMI audio then it is likely PulseAudio
is causing the issues as it has problems with the ALSA drivers. To fix
this simply remove PulseAudio:

    sudo apt-get --purge remove pulseaudio
    sudo apt-get autoremove

Additionally some TVs have problems with mono sound through HDMI, to fix this try setting the "force_stereo" to "yes" in mame.cfg.

If you're getting a black screen when running in Console mode with
Composite output, try removing/commenting out the "overscan_" parameters from "/boot/config.txt" as follows (using disable_overscan doesn't appear to fix it):

    #overscan_left=16
    #overscan_right=16
    #overscan_top=16
    #overscan_bottom=16

If the image goes off your TV screen then you can change the border width by setting "display_border" in mame.cfg. 

GRAPHICS CONFIGURATION
----------------------

To switch off anti-aliasing drawing set the "display_smooth_stretch" to "no" in the mame.cfg. Performance can be impacted depending on the size of your monitor's resolution when switching off anti-aliasing. The "antialias" setting in mame.cfg is only for vector drawing.

Postprocessing scanline drawing is available, the "display_effect" in the mame.cfg controls this. Scanlines work best when "display_smooth_stretch" is set to "no".

SUPPORTED GAMES
---------------

Folder names or ZIP file names are listed on "gamelist.txt" file.
Romsets have to be MAME 0.37b5 ones (July 2000).
Additionaly there are additional romsets from newer MAME versions.

Please use "clrmame.dat" file to convert romsets from other MAME versions to the ones used by this version, using ClrMAME Pro utility, available in next webpage:

http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/

NOTE: File and directory names in Linux are case-sensitive. Put all file and directory names using lower case!

SOUND SAMPLES
-------------

The sound samples are used to get complete sound in some of the oldest games.
They are placed into the 'samples' directory compressed into ZIP files.
The directory and the ZIP files are named using low case!

The sound samples collection can be downloaded in the following link:
http://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/gp2x.cgi?0,0,0,0,5,2511

You can also use "clrmame.dat" file with ClrMAME Pro utility to get the samples pack.

April 10, 2013:

  * Added Mouse support (joysticks override mouse).
  * Fixed kiosk mode.
  * Fixed shinobi crashing (disabled drz80 audio for the rom).

April 06, 2013:

  * HDMI audio option to force stereo for TVs that don't support mono properly. Configured using the "force_stereo" in mame.cfg.

April 01, 2013:

  * Display ROM errors and invalid games messages.

March 26, 2013:

  * Added favourites selection, press Coin 1 (or joystick button 6) to toggle favourites. File Favorites.ini goes in folders directory.

March 20, 2013:

  * Reduced or eliminated sound static.

March 01, 2013:

  * First release

TODO
----

  * Add better rotation support.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

  * Not perfect sound or incomplete in some games. Sometimes simply quiting a game and restarting can fix the sound - believe this is due to ALSA Pi driver bugs. Additionally try removing pulseaudio to improve sound problems.
  * Make sure nothing is running in the background. For best performance run in the console instead of X-Windows. But if experiencing black screen in the console, try running in X-Windows or use the console overscan settings above.
  * The SDL input drivers are a little buggy, if input suddenly stops, reboot the Pi.
  * If a game crashes either during play or on exit try disabling the DrZ80 core (-nodrz80_snd) on the command line.
  * Slow playability in modern games. Most games run at full speed on an overclocked Pi.
  * Memory leaks. In case of errors/crashes reboot your Pi.
